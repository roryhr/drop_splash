This is the code used in my UC Santa Barbara Honors Thesis (Bachelor's Thesis)
"Experimental and theoretical study of pattern identification in physical systems with O(2) symmetry". Santa Barbara, CA. June, 2010.

The code is in MATLAB and we use the [Camera Calibration Toolbox for MATLAB] (http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/index.html) by Jean-Yves Bouguet.



A pdf of my thesis is available online and here. If you're pressed for time,
the publication is shorter (and well-worth citing!):

R. Hartong-Redden and R. Krechetnikov. Pattern identification in systems with S(1) symmetry.
Phys. Rev. E, 14:42--351, 2011.


Also included are PowerPoint slides with lots of great pictures from my APS talk!

R. Hartong-Redden and R. Krechetnikov. Experimental and theoretical study of pattern identification in physical systems on circular domains. APS Division of Fluid Dynamics Meeting, 2010.


Any of the above should describe my experimental setup, data analysis procedure,
and exciting theory of pattern identification on circular domains (S(1), O(2)).

The main function is `rim_analysis.m`.
