This is the code used in my UC Santa Barbara Honors Thesis (Bachelor's Thesis)
"Experimental and theoretical study of pattern identification in physical systems with O(2) symmetry". Santa Barbara, CA. June, 2010.

The code is in MATLAB and we use the MATLAB Camera Calibration Toolbox Jean-Yves Bouguet:

A pdf of my thesis is available online and here. If you're pressed for time,
the publication is shorter (and well-worth citing!).

R Hartong-Redden and R. Krechetnikov. Pattern identification in systems with S(1) symmetry. Phys. Rev. E, 14:42--351, 2011

Both my thesis and publication describe the experimental setup, data analysis procedure,
and exciting new theory of pattern identification on circular domains (S(1), O(2)).
